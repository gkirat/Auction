# Advance Auction Smart Contract


Auction is a Solidity smart contract that facilitates auction functionality for various items.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/gkirat/main.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: [Solidity Compiler](https://soliditylang.org/), [Truffle Framework](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
3. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred Ethereum network.

## Features

- The auction starts running as soon as the contract is deployed.
- It defines a start time block (`stblock`) and an end time block (`etblock`) to set the duration of the auction.
- Bids are submitted using the `bid()` function, and each bid must be higher than or equal to the previous bid plus a predefined bid increment (`bid_increment`).
- The auctioneer can cancel the auction using the `cancelAuc()` function.
- Bids made by different addresses are stored in a mapping.

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred Ethereum network.
2. Use the `bid()` function to participate in the auction by sending Ether along with your bid.
3. The auctioneer can cancel the auction using the `cancelAuc()` function if needed.
